# CVE-2024-21762-PoC
CVE-2024-21762 is an out of bounds write vulnerability in fortinet fortios which leads to unauthenticated remote code execution

# Details:
The vulnerability is out-of-bounds write as described by Fortinet.
as per publicly disclosed some of the informations about this vuln, we know that it have to do with ssl vpn.
so I started diffing the old versions (7.4.2, 7.4.0) with the patched version (7.4.3)
which turns out with lots of newly added lines of patch. but we need only the ssl vpn part of the code.
after digging a little we noticed that some conditions added in case of the headers meet the spesific condition and throw an error to avoid the vuln.
which took my attention and in first attemp I was able to crash the target successfully, and after spending hours and testing deffirent ROP chain, was able to acheive remote code execution on the target.
